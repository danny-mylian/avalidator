## Angular2-like composable (kind-of) validator

Just exploring the sources of [Angular2 validator](https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/master/modules/%40angular/forms/src/validators.ts) and [Ramda](https://github.com/ramda/ramda/tree/master/src) utility functions to create custom angular-like validator that supports composition of the validation rules.
And playing with modern ES ecosystem stuff.

To build, make sure that you have `babel` installed and run `npm install`;

### Roadmap
- [x] test suites [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/)
- [x] static types [Flow](https://flowtype.org/)
- [x] flow-lint
